Good Old Gallery helps you use galleries on multiple pages and posts, it also uses jQuery Cycle for sliding and fading transitions.

== Description ==

Good Old Gallery is a WordPress plugin that helps you upload image galleries that can be used on more than one page/post, it utilizes the built in gallery functionality in WP. Other features include built in jQuery Cycle support and Widgets.

= Main features =

* Uses built in WP gallery functionality.
* [jQuery Cycle](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/).
* Shortcode generator.
* Widgets.
* Stylesheet theme support, per gallery.
* Create your own themes.
* Instant on, no need for coding.
* Plus much more...

== Installation ==

1. Upload `good-old-gallery` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. You now have a new Galleries section underneath Media in the admin menu.
4. Go to *Galleries -> Settings* to setup the basic settings.

= Uploading =

1. Click on *Add New* in the Galleries menu.
2. Give your gallery an administrative title.
3. Click on *Upload images*.
4. Upload your images and add Title, Description and Link if needed.
5. Click on *Save all changes*, close the pop-up.
6. Click on *Publish* to enable your gallery.

= Shortcodes =

To use your new gallery in a page/post you use the `[good-old-gallery]` shortcode, use the generator to build one.

1. Go to a page or a post.
2. Click on the *Add an Image* icon.
3. Click on the *Good Old Gallery* tab.
4. Generate your shortcode and copy it, close the pop-up.
5. Enter HTML mode in the editor.
6. Paste your shortcode where it should be shown.

= Themes =

You can make your own themes, just create a `gog-themes` directory in either `wp-content` or your active themes directory, and the plugin will automatically find any themes located there.

Creating a theme is rather simple, just start out with one of the themes found in the `themes` catalog in `good-old-gallery`.

The structure of a theme is:

`gog-themes 
|- my-theme/ (folder with resources)
|- my-theme.css (this is the only required file) 
|- my-theme.png (must be a png)`

Fill in the file headers in the css, only *Style Name* and *Class* are required, but the more you fill in the better.

Now add some css to style your Good Old Galleries.

If you enable all themes on the settings page and build the css cache, you can use `[good-old-gallery theme="theme-class"]` to use per gallery themes.

= Widgets =

You are also given a new widget called *Good Old Gallery*, use it in regions where a selected gallery always should be shown.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's with Good Old? =

This plugin was actually conceived when the company I work for [Good Old](http://goodold.se/) was redoing their site, I made this plugin to help maintain galleries and specifically galleries in widgets.

Then I figured that this plugin is probably something the general WP user could have use for, so I decided to further develop it on my spare time.

And as you've probably figured out by now, the name Good Old comes from the company I work for.
