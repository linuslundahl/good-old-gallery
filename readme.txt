== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's with Good Old? =

This plugin was actually conceived when the company I work for (Good Old) was redoing their site, I made this plugin to help maintain galleries and specifically galleries in widgets.

Then I figured that this plugin is probably something the general WP user could have use for, so I decided to further develop it on my spare time.

And as you've probably figured out by now, the name Good Old comes from the company I work for.
