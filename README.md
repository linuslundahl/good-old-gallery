# Good Old Gallery

Version 2.0-dev

The version hosted at GitHub is __still in development__ and may contain bugs and unfinished code. __Use at own risk!__

Get the latest stable version from [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/good-old-gallery/).

So what's new?
--------------

* __Flexslider__  
Flexslider is now used as the main slider plugin instead of jQuery Cycle, though Cycle is still supported for backwards compatibility. And more plugins can easily be added.
* __Settings API__  
A lot of work has been put on making the settings page use the built in Settings API.
* __Shortcode generator__  
The shortcode generator has gotten some small fixes.
* __Sorting fields__  
It's now possible to sort the Title, Description and Image output.
* __General bug fixes__  

What's left?
------------

I need to go through and confirm that the widgets are implemented correctly.  
The Edit Gallery page needs a facelift.  
I need to update the included theme to support new markup + Make the default theme support both Cycle and Flexslider or at least make a version for Cycle.
