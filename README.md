So what's new?
--------------

* __Flexslider__  
Flexslider is now used as the main slider plugin instead of jQuery Cycle, though Cycle is still supported for backwards compatibility. And more plugins can easily be added.
* __Settings API__  
A lot of work has been put on making the settings page use the built in Settings API.
* __Shortcode generator__  
The shortcode generator has gotten some small fixes.
* __Sorting fields__  
It's now possible to sort the Title, Description and Image output.
* __General bug fixes__  

What's left?
------------

Not much, I think it's pretty much ready for release on wp.org.
